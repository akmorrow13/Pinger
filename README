The basic structure of the project is done and working. However, 
there is a problem with the situation when the packet is lost or wrong.
The method 'receive' stop the flow of the program until the socket receive
something (Client.java, line 63). So, the client will not send more packet while 
this don't happen. 

My suggestion is to create a thread responsible to receive the packets and to print them in the screen.
With that, the client would continue sending packets independently if it are receiving packets or not.

What do you think?

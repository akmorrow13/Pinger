Hi Alyssa,

I implemented the threading in the Client mode. The program looks working, but we need do more tests. For example, sending pings from my machine to my machine rarely provokes a mistake. So, I don't know whether the program is working with lost packets yet.  I think we need do the simulations in the mininet (step 4).

Please, give your opinion for us decide the next step.

Thank you.
